# NooBaa Operator

NooBaa is an object data service for hybrid and multi cloud environments. NooBaa runs on kubernetes, provides an S3 object store service (and Lambda with bucket triggers) to clients both inside and outside the cluster, and uses storage resources from within or outside the cluster, with flexible placement policies to automate data use cases.

- The operator is running, but there is no noobaa-core-0 pod 

    Make sure that there is a single default storage class with `oc get sc`. run `oc describe sts` for more information

# Developing

- Fork and clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/<username>/noobaa-operator`
- Use minikube: `minikube start`
- Use you package manager to install `go`, `operator-sdk` and `python3`.
- Source the devenv into your shell: `. devenv.sh`
- Build the project: `make`
- Test with the alias `nb` that runs the local operator from `build/_output/bin` (alias created by devenv)
- Install the operator and create the system with: `nb install`
