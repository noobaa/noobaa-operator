# NooBaa
- NooBaa is an object data service for hybrid and multi cloud environments.
- NooBaa can be run on kubernetes (k8s).\
`*` we have more ways to deploy NooBaa, based on the needs, please refer to [noobaa-core](https://github.com/noobaa/noobaa-core/) repository for more information).
- NooBaa is a highly customizable and dynamic data gateway for objects, providing data services such as caching, tiering, mirroring, dedup, encryption, compression, over any storage resource including: Amazon (S3), Google (GCS), Azure (Blob), IBM (COS), other S3-compatble, Filesystems (NSFS), PV-pool etc.
- NooBaa provides an S3 object store service (and Lambda with bucket triggers) to clients both inside and outside the cluster, and uses storage resources from within or outside the cluster, with flexible placement policies to automate data use cases.
- NooBaa goal is to simplify data flows for system administrators by connecting to any of the storage silos from private or public clouds, and providing a single scalable data services, using the same S3 API and management tools. NooBaa allows full control over data placement with dynamic policies per bucket or account.

# NooBaa Operator
NooBaa operator (the Operator) watches for NooBaa changes and reconciles them to apply the desired state.
- The NooBaa operator is following the [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) - you can find extensive documentation in the Kubernetes docs.
  - Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of custom resources ([CRs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)) to manage applications and their components.
  - NooBaa operator is a [controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/). In Kubernetes, controllers are control loops that watch the state of your cluster, then make or request changes where needed. Each controller tries to move the **current state** of the cluster closer to the **desired state**.

#### Reconcile loops
System Reconciler example - the system reconciliation is divided to the following phases:
1. [Verifying](pkg/system/phase1_verifying.go) - checks the validity of the CR (noobaa image, address, etc.).
2. [Creating](pkg/system/phase2_creating.go) - creates the needed resources (secrets, services, etc.).
3. [Connecting](pkg/system/phase3_connecting.go) - populate the statuses of mgmt and s3 services, initialize client for making calls to the server, etc.
4. [Configuring](pkg/system/phase4_configuring.go) - creates default backingstore, default bucketclass, etc.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Install the latest NooBaa CLI
(or pick from the [releases page](https://github.com/noobaa/noobaa-operator/releases)):

```bash
OS="linux"
# or
OS="darwin"

ARCH=amd64
# or
ARCH=arm64

VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/noobaa/noobaa-operator/releases/latest | jq -r '.name')
curl -LO https://github.com/noobaa/noobaa-operator/releases/download/$VERSION/noobaa-operator-$VERSION-$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz
tar -xvzf noobaa-operator-$VERSION-$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz
chmod +x noobaa-operator
mv noobaa-operator /usr/local/bin/noobaa
```

Install with Mac Homebrew:
```bash
brew install noobaa/noobaa/noobaa
```

Install NooBaa to Kubernetes:
```bash
# Prepare namespace and set as current (optional)
kubectl create ns noobaa
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace noobaa

# Install the operator and system on your cluster:
noobaa install

# You can always get system status and information with:
noobaa status
```

### Usage
#### NooBaa CLI
The CLI helps with most management tasks and focuses on ease of use for manual operations or scripts.

Notes:
- Help: `noobaa --help`\
use `noobaa <command> --help` for more information about any command.
- kubeconfig - same as kubectl - the CLI operates on the current context from kubeconfig which can be changed with `export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/custom/kubeconfig` or use the `--kubeconfig` and `--namespace` flags.
- local clusters (minikube, rancher desktop): use `noobaa install --mini` or `--dev` to allocate less resources.
- Uninstalling: `noobaa uninstall`

**3) Current version**\
When you want to print the current CLI version and images:
```bash
$ noobaa version
```

```
INFO[0000] CLI version: 5.16.0
INFO[0000] noobaa-image: noobaa/noobaa-core:5.16.0
INFO[0000] operator-image: noobaa/noobaa-operator:5.16.0
```

## Troubleshooting
- Verify that there are enough resources for noobaa pods:
    - `kubectl describe pod | less`
    - `kubectl get events --sort-by .metadata.creationTimestamp`
- Make sure that there is a single **default** storage class:
    - `kubectl get sc`
    - or specify which storage class to use with `noobaa install --db-storage-class XXX --pv-pool-default-storage-class YYY`

## Documentation
You can find documentation related to noobaa operator and noobaa components in kubernetes in [doc](doc) directory.
For example:
- [NooBaa](doc/about-noobaa.md) - Basic terminology and links to videos.
- Customer Resources Definitions ([CRDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#adding-custom-resources)):
A custom resource is an extension of the Kubernetes API that is not necessarily available in a default Kubernetes installation. CRDs allow users to create new types of resources without adding another API server.
Once a custom resource is installed, users can create, update and access its objects using [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/), just as they do for built-in resources.
  - [NooBaaSystem](doc/noobaa-crd.md) - The basic CRD to deploy a NooBaa system. Represents a single installation of NooBaa that includes a set of sub-resources (backing-stores, bucket-classes, and buckets).
  - [BackingStore](doc/backing-store-crd.md) - Storage resources. These storage targets are used to store deduplicated, compressed and encrypted chunks of data.
  - [NamespaceStore](doc/namespace-store-crd.md) - Data resources. These storage targets are used to store and read plain data.
  - [BucketClass](doc/bucket-class-crd.md) - Policies applied to a class of buckets, defines bucket policies relating to data placement.
  - [Account](doc/noobaa-account-crd.md) - We use the account to receive new credentials set for accessing different noobaa services.
- Bucket Claim:
  - [OBC Provisioner](doc/obc-provisioner.md) - OBC (Object Bucket Claim) is currently the main CR to provision buckets, however it is being deprecated in favor of COSI.
  - [COSI Provisioner](doc/cosi-provisioner.md) - COSI (Container Object Storage Interface) is a new kubernetes storage standard (like CSI, Container Storage Interface) to provision object storage buckets.
- DB:
  - THe default DB is postgres, internal in the cluster.
  - [External Postgresql DB support](doc/external-postgres.md)
- Other:
  - [HA controller](doc/high-availability-controller.md) - High Availability controller improves NooBaa pods recovery in the case of a node failure.
  - [Admission Controller](doc/noobaa-admission.md) - The utilize k8s admission webhook feature to validate various NooBaa custom resource definitions.
