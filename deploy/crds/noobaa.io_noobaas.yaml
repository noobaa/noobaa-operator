                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:

                        index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                        referencing a part of an object.

                          NodePorts are the most basic network available.
                          NodePorts use the networks available on the hosts of kubernetes nodes.
                          This generally works from within a pod, and from the internal
                          network of the nodes, but may fail from public network.

                          Every pod has an IP in the cluster and the pods network is a mesh
                          so the operator running inside a pod in the cluster can use this address.
                          Note: pod IPs are not guaranteed to persist over restarts, so should be rediscovered.
                          Note2: when running the operator outside of the cluster, pod IP is not accessible.
