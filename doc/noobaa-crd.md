# NooBaa CRD

NooBaa CRD represents a single installation of NooBaa that includes a set of sub-resources (backing-stores, bucket-classes, and buckets) and has a lifecycle as a single integrated system.


# Definitions

- Kubebuilder types: [noobaa_types.go](../pkg/apis/noobaa/v1alpha1/noobaa_types.go)
- CRD: [noobaa.io_noobaas_crd.yaml](../deploy/crds/noobaa.io_noobaas_crd.yaml)
- CR: [noobaa.io_v1alpha1_noobaa_cr.yaml](../deploy/crds/noobaa.io_v1alpha1_noobaa_cr.yaml)


# Reconcile

The operator watches for NooBaaSystem changes and reconcile them to apply the following deployment:

- Kubernetes Resources
  - Core server:
    - StatefulSet
    - Service (mgmt)
    - Service (s3)
    - Secrets
    - Route/Ingress (?)
  - Endpoints:
    - Deployment
    - HorizontalPodAutoscaler
- NooBaa Setup
  - Admin Account
    - Once the server is up and running the operator will call an API to setup a new system in the server which returns a secret token:
      - `noobaa-admin-mgmt-secret` will be created to contain the admin account token. It will be used for next API calls on this system.
      - `noobaa-admin-s3-secret` will be created with the admin S3 credentials to allow easy onboarding for the admin.
  - Internal backing-store
    - In order to reduce the friction of setting up backing-stores right after deployment, we create an internal backing-store with the following characteristics:
      - The internal store has limited size
      - It is using the core server PV for storage
      - It should not be used for production workloads.
  - Default bucket-class
    - This is a simple class that uses just the internal backing-store.
    - Once backing-stores are added the default class should be updated and existing data will automatically move from internal store to the new stores.
  - first.bucket
    - The operator will create a `first.bucket` using the default bucket-class.


# Status

The operator will set the status of the NooBaaSystem to represent the current state of reconciling to the desired state.\
Here is the example status structure as would be returned by a `kubectl get noobaa -n noobaa -o yaml`:

```yaml

# Custom Images

The NooBaa spec below shows how to override the noobaa-core image used for the system deployment. Another way to change the default image is to set the env `NOOBAA_CORE_IMAGE` on the operator pod (on its deployment) which makes the operator assume a different default core image even when the NooBaa spec is not specifying it. In any case when using custom images, you will have to make sure the operator and core images are compatible with eachother.

```yaml
apiVersion: noobaa.io/v1alpha1
kind: NooBaa
metadata:
  name: noobaa
  namespace: noobaa
spec:
  image: noobaa/noobaa-core:v9999.9.9
```

# Private Image Registry

See below how to set `spec.imagePullSecret` in order to [pull from a private image repository](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/)

```yaml
apiVersion: noobaa.io/v1alpha1
kind: NooBaa
metadata:
  name: noobaa
  namespace: noobaa
spec:
  image: noobaa/noobaa-core:v9999.9.9
  dbImage: mongo:3.6.23
  imagePullSecret:
    name: <SECRET-NAME>
```

# Custom CPU and Memory Resources

The NooBaa spec can be used to control the resources of each component. Below is an example of how to set the spec to use custom compute resources. 

Keep the following in mind when choosing your custom resources values:
- Endpoints are deployed as a deployment with autoscaling, so the `minCount`/`maxCount` values should be used to set a range for the autoscaler to use, and this is typically how you can increase the system's S3 throughput. It should be preferred to increase the number of endpoints rather than increasing the resources for each endpoint.
- Setting `requests` and `limits` to the same exact value will make the pods get a "Guaranteed" QoS class - see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/.
- When running on minikube or other small environments, the noobaa cli provides a `--mini` flag that sets a spec of minimal resources.

```yaml
apiVersion: noobaa.io/v1alpha1
kind: NooBaa
metadata:
  name: noobaa
  namespace: noobaa
spec:
  coreResources:
    requests:
      cpu: "8"
      memory: "16Gi"
    limits:
      cpu: "8"
      memory: "16Gi"
  dbResources:
    requests:
      cpu: "8"
      memory: "16Gi"
    limits:
      cpu: "8"
      memory: "16Gi"
  endpoints:
    minCount: 4
    maxCount: 4
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "2"
        memory: "4Gi"
      limits:
        cpu: "2"
        memory: "4Gi"
```

# Delete

The operator will detect deletion of a system CR, and will followup by deleting all the owned resources.

This is done by connecting owner references and letting Garbage Collection do the rest as described here:

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/
